# Reproducibility Made Easy:
The ***Reproducibility Made Easy*** application provides researchers and clinicians with the ability to comprehensively document study parameters. It automates the [MRSinMRS table]('https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33559967/') population from a single datafile loaded with a simple GUI, facilitating result replication, and method evaluation. This software also generates a straight-forward MRS methods section (as LateX and PDF) which ensures reporting accuracy and result interpretability.

## Summary:
At the 2023 inaugural MRS Hackathon, Antonia Susnjar suggested a need for an automated software pipeline to encourage adherence to the consensus Minimum Reporting Standards in Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS in MRS), so here we are!

## Keywords:
Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Automated Software, MRS in MRS Consensus

## Uses:
A fully automated cross-platform software application for completing the MRS in MRS Table and generating a MRS-sepcific methods section

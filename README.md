# Reproducibility Made Easy:
The ***Reproducibility Made Easy*** application provides researchers and clinicians the ability to comprehensively document study parameters. It automates table population from a single datafile, facilitating result replication, and method evaluation. This software also generates a straight-forward MRS methods section which ensures reporting accuracy and result interpretability.

## Summary:
At the 2023 inaugural MRS Hackathon, Antonia Susnjar suggested a need for an automated software pipeline to encourage adherence to the consensus Minimum Reporting Standards in Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS in MRS). 


## Keywords:
Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Automated Software, MRS in MRS Consensus

## Uses:
A fully automated cross-platform software application for completing the MRS in MRS Table and generating a MRS-sepcific methods section
